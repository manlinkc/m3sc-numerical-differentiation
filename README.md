#M3SC Coursework 3 : Numerical Differentiation

Project 3: ‘Numerical Differentiation’ completed for ‘Scientific Computing’. All code has been written in Python.

The file `p1_dev.py` contains code for simulating a non-linear wave model using fast Fourier transform for differentiation and the finite difference method and compares the accuracy and performance. `p2_dev.py` contains an implementation of the Principal Component Analysis algorithm used on a dataset of meteorological data.
